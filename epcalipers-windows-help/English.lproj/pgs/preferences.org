** Changing options
Options can be selected using the *Tools | Options* menu item.  You can change default settings as you prefer, including caliper colors, line width of the calipers, default calibration intervals and number of intervals used to calculate mean intervals.  For example, if you usually use just 1 RR interval to calculate the QTc, set the number of mean RR intervals for the QTc measurement to 1 interval.  Remember though you can override any of these values when you actually do the measurements.

** Options explained
- *Default amplitude calibration* This is the default value for calibration of amplitude calipers.  Put whatever value you usually use to calibrate here.
- *Default time calibration* This is the default value that appears in the text box when calibrating time calipers.  If you usually calibrate to a certain value (say 200 msec) then it is useful to change this default value.
- *Amplitude text position* Position of amplitude caliper text labels in relation to caliper.
- *Auto-position text* When set to true, caliper text labels will automatically reposition themselves to avoid being obscured by the caliper or by the edges of the windows.
- *Caliper color* This is the color of unselected newly added calipers.  Note that this color can be overwritten by right-clicking on a caliper and selecting *Caliper Color*.
- *Selected caliper color* This is the color of the selected caliper.
- *Line width* Increase or decrease this value to make the caliper lines thicker or thinner.
- *Time text position* Position of time caliper text labels in relation to caliper.
- *Number of intervals (mean RR)* The default number of intervals you use to measure mean RR intervals.
- *Number of intervals (QTc)* The default number of intervals you use to measure the mean RR interval when making QTc measurements.
- *QTc formula* Select the QTc formula you want to use for QTc calculations.  The 4 most commonly used formulas are available: Bazett, Framingham, Fridercia, and Hodges.  Selecting /All/ will display the results of all 4 formulas when calculating the QTc.
- *Round msec and rates* Choose how msec and rate values are displayed.  Choices include round to the nearest integer (e.g. 305.463 becomes 305, 1010.728 becomes 1011), display 4 digits (e.g. 305.5 and 1011), round to tenths (e.g. 305.5 and 1010.7), and round to hundredths (305.46 and 1010.73).  Note that values in secs or values using other units and calculated values such as QTc are always shown using 4 digits.
