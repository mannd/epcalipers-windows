* [[../../shrd/icon_32x32@2x.png]] Images
Images include files in typical image formats such as JPG, BMP, and PNG, as well as PDF files.  Note that unlike with earlier versions of EP Calipers, it is not necessary to download and install /Ghostscript/ on your computer in order to open PDF files.  To load ECG images use one of the following methods.
* Loading an image
** Open command
Use the *File | Open* menu command (or keyboard shortcut Ctrl-O) to select an
image stored on your computer.  You can also use the *Open* button to do the same thing.  
** Drag and drop
You can drag and drop an image file onto the program window and it will load.
** Right-click on an image file
Even when *EP Calipers* is not open, you can use the right click menu to open an image file.  Select *Open with* from the right click menu and select *EP Calipers* to open the image file.  This method can also be used to open email attachments.
** Multi-page PDFs
If you load a PDF file with multiple pages, the first page will be shown initially.  You can use the *Image | Previous Page* and *Next Page* menu items to change pages, or the keyboard shortcuts.  Note that a big PDF file may take a long time to load.
** Opening /AliveCor™/ ECGs
[[https://www.alivecor.com/][AliveCor]] ECGs can be saved as PDF files.  Load them with any of the above methods (except drag and drop).
* Adjusting the image
** Moving the image
If the image is too large for the window, you can either enlarge the
window as usual (such as using the Windows maximize button), or scroll
around the image using the window scroll bars.  You can use the mouse
scroll wheel to scroll the image up and down.  You can also shrink the
image by zooming out as described below.
** Rotation
If the ECG image is rotated or tilted, use the *Image | Rotation* menu commands to correct this.  You can rotate by 90°, 1°, or 0.1° increments in either direction.  The keyboard shortcuts for rotation are useful.  *Important:* You should rotate your image before calibrating your calipers or making measurements.  Once an image has been calibrated, rotation will affect the accuracy of the calibration.  For this reason, if you rotate the image after it has been calibrated, the calibration will clear automatically and you will need to recalibrate.
** Zooming
You can also use the Zoom buttons (*+* and *-*) at the lower left of the window to zoom in and out.  Zooming is also available in the *Image* menu, which includes a *Reset zoom* option to restore the original unzoomed image.   Note that Caliper calibration *does* adjust with zooming.  There is no need to recalibrate the calipers after zooming.
* Saving or printing an edited image
Use the *File | Save* menu item to save the current image (including calipers) to a file.  You can open the saved image file on disk by double clicking it.  It is usually possible to print the file from whatever program you have chosen to open image files.  You can also print directly from *EP Calipers* using the *File | Print* menu item.
* Transparent windows
** What is transparent window mode?
Sometimes it is easier to open an image or PDF file on your Desktop using an external program, such as a web browser or photo app, and then make measurements directly on this image.  *EP Calipers* allows you do this using /transparent window mode/.  In this mode, the main window is transparent, allowing you to measure whatever is underneath the window using calipers.  Transparent window mode looks like this:

** Activating transparent window mode
Use the *Window | Transparent window* menu item to activate and inactivate transparent window mode.  
** Things to watch out for with transparent windows
*** Calibration implications
When you load an image into *EP Calipers* the normal way and calibrate your calipers, the program will automatically adjust the calibration factor when you zoom the image.  In transparent window mode the program has no way to figure out if you zoom the underlying image and invalidate calibration.  Take care to recalibrate your calipers if you zoom your image in a program external to *EP Calipers*.
*** Change modes
All calipers and calibration are cleared when changing modes.  While in transparent window mode, if you open an image file, the program reverts to normal image mode.
*** Clicking through to the underlying window
When in transparent mode, the transparent parts of the window are also transparent to mouse clicks.  If you click on the underlying window, it becomes the active window on top, and the *EP Calipers* window may disappear underneath.  In order to help prevent this, you can add [[file:calipers.org::*Caliper%20handles][handles]] to calipers, making them easy to click and move.  [[file:preferences.org::*Changing%20options][Options]] can be set to add the handles automatically each time you enter transparent mode.  The default setting for this option is to add caliper handles whenever you activate transparent mode.  Alternatively there is now an option -- *Transparent window on top* -- that makes the window stay on top during transparent window mode.
** Alternative transparency
On newer versions of Windows 10 (the Creators Update, version 1709, and possible other versions), full transparency doesn't seem to work.  Symptoms include not being able to move calipers or click buttons while in transparent window mode.  If this occurs, or if you prefer a different transparency mode, active alternative transparency mode using the option *Use alternative transparency*.  This creates a semi-transparent window, and you can adjust the degree of transparency using the *Transparency alpha value* option.
