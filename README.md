# EP Calipers for Microsoft Windows

## Description 
This is the MS Windows version of EP Calipers.
Versions for Android, iOS and Mac OS X already exist.

EP Calipers provides electronic calipers for making measurements on
images of ECGs or other recordings.  Simple calculations such as mean
heart rate and corrected QT intervals can be performed directly in the
app.

A Windows Forms version is being developed initially, with plans for a
Windows Universal app in the future.
